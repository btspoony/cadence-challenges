# How to create your own simple NFT contract on Flow testnet

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have created a deployer account on Flow testnet
- Make sure your deployer account has Flow tokens
- Make sure to have [Flow CLI](https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli/install) installed
- Mare sure to install Visual Studio Code
- Make sure to have Cadence extension installed in Visual Studio Code

## Write your NFT smart contract

We are using Flow playground for writing the smart contract

In Flow playground, you can use the ExampleNFT contract on account `0x04`

<https://play.flow.com/ff662c89-127e-4b93-a84d-97f2e4adb2ef?type=account&id=c537a46e-c093-41ce-a4e7-7304eb09e2fb&storage=none>

### Step 1: Rename contract

Rename `ExampleNFT` to whatever you want

Use `CMD+F` or `CTRL+F` and type `ExampleNFT` to find all instances. Look out for case sensitivity.

### Step 2: Change NFT information

On line 101, 115, 131, 136-138, and 142 you will want to change the NFT information to fit your needs.

### Step 3: Setup your cadence folder

- Create a folder with whatever name you want
- Create flow.json

Open your terminal or powershell and go to your newly created folder

Run the command `flow init` to initialize a flow.json

- Create a subfolder called `cadence` and inside that subfolder create another called `contracts`
- Add your contracts from the Flow playground to your `contracts` folder
- Make sure to change the import paths in each contract

If you have done the above correctly your setup should look like this

### Step 4: Configure your flow.json

Replace the code in your flow.json with the following:

```json
{
 "contracts": {
  "ExampleNFT": "./cadence/contracts/ExampleNFT.cdc",

  "MetadataViews": {
   "source": "./cadence/contracts/MetadataViews.cdc",
   "aliases": {
    "mainnet": "0x1d7e57aa55817448",
    "testnet": "0x631e88ae7f1d7c20"
   }
  },
  "NonFungibleToken": {
   "source": "./cadence/contracts/NonFungibleToken.cdc",
   "aliases": {
    "testnet": "0x631e88ae7f1d7c20",
    "mainnet": "0x1d7e57aa55817448"
   }
  }
 },
 "networks": {
  "emulator": "127.0.0.1:3569",
  "mainnet": "access.mainnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000",
  "sandboxnet": "access.sandboxnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000",
  "testnet": "access.devnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000"
 },
 "accounts": {
  "emulator-account": {
   "address": "f8d6e0586b0a20c7",
   "key": "ce795966a578dedda983692db8c0cd03501305b0855e6ded0591cacac53ffc26"
  },
  "testnet-account": {
   "address": "ADD YOUR FLOW ADDRESS",
   "key": {
    "type": "hex",
    "index": 0,
    "signatureAlgorithm": "ECDSA_P256",
    "hashAlgorithm": "SHA3_256",
    "privateKey": "ADD YOUR PRIVATE KEY"
   }
  }
 },
 "deployments": {
  "emulator": {
   "emulator-account": [
    "MetadataViews",
    "NonFungibleToken",
    "ExampleNFT"
   ]
  },
  "testnet": {
   "testnet-account": ["ExampleNFT"]
  }
 }
}
```

- Replace "ADD YOUR FLOW ADDRESS" with your flow address
- Replace "ADD YOUR PRIVATE KEY" with your private key
- Replace "ExampleNFT" with the name you have chosen  
  Note: Make sure not to upload your flow.json to github or anywhere online to keep your private key PRIVATE!

### Step 5: Deploy your contract

Go to the root folder that has the flow.json and run the command `flow project deploy --network=testnet`

TADA!!

You have now deployed your NFT contract
