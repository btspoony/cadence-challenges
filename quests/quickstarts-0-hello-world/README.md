# Hello World

ðŸŽ« Deploy a simple HelloWorld contract to learn the basics of the Flow blockchain and Cadence. You'll use:

- The local Flow emulator to deploy smart contracts.
- The local Flow dev wallet to log into test accounts.
- A template Next.js app with sample scripts and transactions to interact with your contract.

ðŸŒŸ The final deliverable is a DApp that lets users read and change a greeting field on Flow testnet.
